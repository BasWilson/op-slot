honestly, this is the messiest and most ugly code I've written in recent times, but I just wanted to see how python works :)

oh and I have no clue how pip works, I really am just a Node JS peasanttt.

## how to use
install these pip packages: flask, pyjwt and then just run app.py with python3. it's probably a good idea to create a virtual env as well before installing the packages.
