# op-slot
## ✨ heads up ✨
This whole project is meant to get me out of my web dev comfort zone of nodejs, ts, js, react and that whole stack. 
so honestly, this is the messiest and most ugly code I've written in recent times, but I just wanted to see how python and swift ui work :)

oh and I have no clue how pip works, I really am just a web dev peasanttt.

## ✌🏻 how to use 
install these pip packages: flask, pyjwt and then just run app.py with python3. it's probably a good idea to create a virtual env as well before installing the packages.

## 🙈 oh, there's also a frontend 
so I've also created a little swift ui app so "Op slot" can actually function as an app. Again this will be my first swift app for Mac OS so it's probably really bad.
